<span style="font-family:Arial sans-serif;font-size:14px;">OAuth allows you to act as user of an external platform without knowing the identifiers (user name and password) of this user.</span>

<span style="font-family:Arial sans-serif;font-size:14px;">Several external platforms (among which Google, Twitter, Facebook) propose APIs for which you have the ability to connect with the information belonging to one of their users. This identification is performed via OAuth. Therefore, all the requests performed on their services (API, ...) will require an access token identifying both the application (the "client") and the user.</span>

<span style="font-family:Arial sans-serif;font-size:14px;">The example proposes to connect to Google and Microsoft via the AuthConnect function and the OAuth2Parameter type.</span>
